## Overview
This game was developed using JavaScript. 

It was developed as one of the criteria of evaluation in the course of Introduction to Web Programming. The game needs to involve a player moving around a grid. There will be one goal-element that scores points if the player moves to it. There will be an enemy-element that will end the game if the player touches it.

### Objectives

- As an advanced feature, walls can be used to restrict movement around the board. ✅
- Instead of moving immediately when the user presses an arrow key, a command will be added to their program to move up, move down, etc. A complete program will consist of exactly 5 commands, and only a complete program can be executed. ✅
- When the user clicks on the button to run the player program, the commands are executed one by one using an interval. ✅
- Each time a command is executed, the enemy will also move once ✅
